# Ai Portrait Generator

## Project description
   This project was created as part of the course "Project KMI and Project PSE" in the winter semester 2024/25 at Hochschule Darmstadt. The goal is to develop a web application that allows users to easily create impressive portrait images in various styles. The foundation is an AI model that generates personalized portraits using reference images.


## Inspiration  
We were inspired by existing tools such as the [CapCut AI Portrait Generator](https://www.capcut.com/tools/ai-portrait-generator) and [Canva AI Portrait Generator](https://www.capcut.com/tools/ai-portrait-generator).  

## How It Works  
1. **Intuitive Image Uploads**  
Users can upload multiple reference images of a person to create the foundation for personalized portrait generation. The user-friendly interface ensures easy interaction.  

2. **Wide Selection of Styles**  
A wide variety of artistic styles is available. This allows each user to choose the perfect style for their needs and preferences.  

3. **AI-Powered Portrait Generation**  
Our advanced AI model transforms the uploaded reference images into unique portraits, generated in the chosen style.  

4. **Direct Download**  
The generated portraits can be downloaded directly. This makes the user’s personalized portrait available at any time—ideal for digital use or printing on high-quality media.
